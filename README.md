# string-manipulation
Here are some of the exercises I did with string manipulation. 

After you input a string, you will be able to:

* Calculate the number of characters and vowels
* Get the first, middle, and last letter
* Remove the second to last word
* Get the index of the first vowel
* Remove all vowels
